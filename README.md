# 👨‍👦‍👦 The Tri-Bro Dev Squad

Welcome to our GitHub profile! We’re the three brothers behind this repo: **Codezilla**, **BugBuster**, and **Commitment Issues**. Together, we form the ultimate coding trifecta—like a superhero team, but with fewer capes and more caffeine!

## Who Are We?

- **Codezilla**: The eldest brother, master of the keyboard, and a self-proclaimed code wizard. When he’s not conjuring up algorithms, you can find him arguing with his coffee machine about which brew is best. Spoiler: it’s always espresso.

- **BugBuster**: The middle brother, and part-time debugging detective. Armed with a magnifying glass and an endless supply of snacks, he fearlessly hunts down bugs in the wild (or in our code). His motto? “No bug left behind... unless it's a Monday.”

- **Commitment Issues**: The youngest, who’s still figuring out if he wants to be a developer, designer, or the next TikTok star. He has a passion for side projects that last about as long as his attention span—so expect lots of unfinished repositories and random memes!

## Our Skills

- **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some Java (the kind that keeps you awake at 2 AM).
- **Frameworks**: React, Angular, and whatever new fad we can convince ourselves to learn this week.
- **Other**: Mastering the art of procrastination and perfecting the “I’ll do it tomorrow” technique.

## Our Projects

- **Family Recipe API**: A collection of our mom’s secret recipes (shh, don’t tell her).
- **The Great Sibling Showdown**: A competitive game where we see who can break the most code in the least time. Spoiler: it’s always Codezilla.
- **Caffeinated Code**: A blog where we review different coffee blends. Trust us, it’s more entertaining than it sounds!

## Fun Fact

We once tried to collaborate on a project while simultaneously building a pillow fort. Let’s just say the fort was more successful than the code!
